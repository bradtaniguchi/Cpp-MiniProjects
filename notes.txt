ALL CODE WAS WRITTEN BY ME, with help of internet haha
=========
I need to understand how C++ handles their class declarations and basic types
since its kind of odd and nothing like what Im used tooo...

Interesting, but makes sense, very disjointed compared
to Java and Python.

Might check out Boost
==========
Going to work on stack implimentation test.
==========
Make a FlipFlop experiment? I have an idea with arrays, FlipFlops to make
a binary adder, be cool

========
Adding more sorting algorithms, I have an idea to run a certain one depending
on the number of inputs, the "supersort" combines all the sorting algorithms 
depending on  the size of the input.
